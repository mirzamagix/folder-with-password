# Windows Folder Password Lock [en]

Using this small but nice batch-script you can easily protect your private folder with your own password, so no one else can see your private files.

**Note that this kind of protection is not very secure and can easily be bypassed by someone with a little bit of knowledge. Do not use this method to protect really important files.**

### How can I use this?

1. Start copying the **whole** text from the file [folder_with_password.txt](../folder_with_password.txt) into a new file on your computer.
2. Replace the text *INSERT_PASSWORD_HERE* inside your own file with your desired password.
3. Save your file as a **.bat file** and start it once.
4. Your file is now ready to be used. You can now move as many files as you want in your secret folder and lock the folder by executing the .bat-file. If you now want to unlock it again you can simply start the .bat-file and enter your password.
